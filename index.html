      </p>
      <section id="band-bio">
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grizzly T was born from a smog cloud above Valhalla,
          Florida, the second largest landlocked mining island in Florida. He
          was raisesd in his wild habitat, free from the tyranny of modern
          jazz-fusion. At 18, Grizzly T was trained in ballet and professional
          relaxing for 4 half-days at a Dojo in Daytona. After being trapped in
          his own walk-in closet for six years (not a metaphor (kind of a
          metaphor)) he found the world’s highest yelp-rated fantasy globe-maker
          Rick Nasty, re-organizing his hd-dvd collection to be in order of
          having the most relatable plot. After a brief wrastlin' due to
          Grizzly’s disgust for contemporary plot devices in mainstream media, a
          truce was called, and the Salvation was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grizzly and Rick went to get a drink at their
          favorite giant titty bar, Club Midia. Coincidentally, that night, a
          local DJ named Skinny Chesney was slangin spicy beats with slick high
          bit-rate samples. The Salvation boys were so amazed by his tasty
          talent that they knew they had to join forces. The next afternoon,
          after binge drinking cherry Brandy and Sprite Remix until their bed
          time at 11am, all three current members of the Salvation woke up in a
          co-ed cuddle puddle so hairy, the likes of which had never been seen
          before, and for the sake of all humanity, hopefully will never be seen
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief turpentine toke sesh, they set off to
          prove wrong the urban legend of The Whoopi Chimera of the Last Texaco
          on Earth. After a chill ass road trip, the boys arrived and saw the
          Beast with blood and cheese dust dripping from her mouth. BUT FIRST,
          they noticed a gnar-ass looking novelty souvenir stand outside the
          Texaco. A man named Dyerk Charlkoal greets them with a spirited, "suh,
          dewdz." For sale, he had titanium spurs and some suspect pokemon
          cards. "Dem fake," declared Skinny. "Tru dat," added Rick. A fire
          raged inside Grizzly, for he loved Pokemon cards so, so much. Grizzly
          inquired to the strange salesman, Dyerk, “Is ‘em?” To which Dyerk
          replied, “These shiny bois right here, are the real thing. More than
          you could ever possibly know.” T, satisfied and thoroughly convinced,
          proclaimed, “skword.”
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grizzly turned to the Chimera, and declared without
          fear, "This Beast must die!" and chucked a handful of Dyerk’s titanium
          spurs right at the Whoopi Chimera's face, landing directly between
          where its eyebrows should have been. At that moment, the chimera
          transformed back into a human, and revealed itself to be Whoopi
          Goldberg. "Thank you Salvation for breaking the chimera curse! Now I
          can get back to writing my screenplay for ‘Sister Act 3: The Color
          Purpler’." The boys looked at each other uncomfortably, and after a
          collective sigh, they decided they thought Dyerk was pretty cool after
          all, being impressed with his collection of autographed Smash Mouth
          B-sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Grizzly T and the Salvation had
          amassed about 50 or so groupies and total sluts, and Dyerk finally
          mentions that he won a sweepstakes in which the grand prize was Smash
          Mouth's private Cessna plane. They picked it up the plane from the
          band at the Sonic Drive-in down the road, along with some tasty tater
          tot milkshakes, and helly feckin corndogs. After mysteriously
          acquiring Ronnie Van Zandt’s one-of-a-kind plane trailer hitch, the
          crew flew back to Valhalla because apparently Grizzly T had a quiche
          in the oven this whole fuckin time.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is when things got lit.</p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way back home, the trailer accidentally
          clipped the wing of one seriously funky flying creature. They
          emergency landed to scoop his ass up and take him with them back to
          Valhalla. The bird turned out to be legendary bass player Funkmaster
          Hawk. But the Hawkinator was injured. He was injured bad. He laid
          asleep until it was 4:20pm. When he awoke, the band apologized for
          knocking him out of the sky, and asked him if there was anything they
          could do to ease his pain. Hawk could hardly muster the strength to
          whisper, “My dudes, I need Jager martinis with sour punch straws, my
          dudes.”
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also this dude named Lee who could shred
          like fuck, but he didn’t have any shoes on and he had hair growing out
          of where his toenails shoulda been and the whole band somehow didn’t
          notice this for like hours, and they immediately kicked him out of the
          band.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, this group of ruffians got a show booked at
          the Decatur Thunderdome and Wig Store. They were opening for a
          once-in-a-lifetime, one-man-show by the name of Jimmy Trampolini.
          Jimmy’s performance was so full of righteous 1080s and radical indy
          grabs, while also playing rhythm guitar and reading the current
          weather forecast on a mini trampoline, that the Salvation’s brains
          grew new funk lobes. Without even asking him, Jimmy threw his
          trampoline in the front seat of the Cessna and joined the Salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone chugged a bunch of helium balloons,
          they were floating by ancient Egypt, and the salvy squah noticed a
          hieroglyph of an ancient, legendary man absolutely fucking up some
          bitch ass mosquitos. The Salvation performed a ritual sacrifice to
          resurrect this epic conqueror, known the world over as mosquitos’
          arch-enemy. A wicked cauldron concoction of each band member’s shaved
          eyebrows mixed with perfectly crisped French Toast grilled cheese
          sandwiches, combined with blessed Fiji water and a teaspoon of that
          one color of gatorade that you remember from when you were a kid, but
          then they changed the formula and tried to sell it back to you again,
          but it just isn’t the same, and you honkin’ know which one I’m
          talmbout. The band stirred and stirred this foul mixture until the
          mighty Dom Chimlinsley appeared! When the band asked Dom why they had
          to shave their eyebrows in order to summon him, he replied, “You
          didn’t need to, but I thought it’d be funny.” The band was shocked at
          the moxie of such a phenomenal (and other-worldly) prank, but they had
          one final test. They brought Dom to one of the stickiest, most vile
          swamps they knew of, a remote location just outside of Panama City
          Beach, and Dom proceeded to “take care of” the mosquito infestation.
          Needless to slay, it was a god-damned blood bath. The gang was so
          impressed with Dom’s mosquito-obliteration talent that they had no
          choice but to invite him along on tour. Dom agreed, but under one
          condition: that the Salvation understood that he was not just born to,
          but literally destined to pork.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years passed, and so did many doinks.</p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tour returned to the Great North, the brehs
          found an entire field of magic mushrooms, and for some reason they
          decided to see “who can most eat them before they die” (their words, I
          swear). 12 months passed and it truly defied nature that any of them
          survived. Grizzly T did win the contest, but not necessarily in a good
          way. As reality slowly faded back into the foreground, the rag tag
          funky nitchskrehs found themselves playing to a sloth (which really is
          the word for group of bears) of sun bears in the forest. Among these
          ferocious yet cuddly bears is where they found the ittiest of biddies,
          Itty Bitty, the most succulent of sun beezies, Saccagawhoopass, and
          the most baddassest of bad bear asses, Susan B Bossbitch, who had all
          three been living amongst the bear colony for several years. During
          their time there, the feral bears had taught them buttery smooth vocal
          harmonies, katana fishing, honey-sweet bear dance moves, and the
          ability to summon glitter tornados, which is obviously a glitter-nado.
          After months of glitter-nados, constant and frequent Grizzly T roast
          sessions, and never-ending belly-button lint collecting contests, the
          Salvation were now walking, shredding, glitter bois, and decided that
          these pitted bear babes were so cool, that it would be an honor to
          have them join the Salvation. And off they went...
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few jamokey-tokes later, the band had earned a
          residency playing at the local Valhalla Community Technical
          Institute’s designated smoking area 3 times a day. After 21
          consecutive weeks of getting tipped in cigarette butts, parking
          tickets, and leftover vending machine nickels, Funkmaster Hawk was
          back to his full strength at last. Hawk imparted on them the deep dark
          meaning of funk and took them under his wings. Under his tutelage, the
          Salvation, along with the Sun Bears bloomed into a
          psychotropic-wet-dream-inducing-funkgasm, but then immediately hit a
          writing block and fell into creative dead space.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This went on for 10 years. Grizzly despaired.</p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, during a combination of Hot Pocket
          cheesy-lava induced third degree burns and a severe taint chafing
          accident, Grizzly T had a vision. An imported can of Scotch with the
          banana hammock of Chris Hemsworth spoke to Grizzly and he said, “Climb
          McScobenstien Mountain to discover the Funk that lies within.” Grizzly
          knew what he must do. Grizzly informed the band of his vision, while
          purposely leaving out the girthy banana hammock detail, and gave a
          rousing motivational speech and convinced the band to climb the
          mountain with him! “But first,” imparted Skinny Chesney, “we should
          stop for nutty buddys, my dudes,” to which Grizzly could only reply,
          “slick duh, mug”. After the nutty buddys were chompetized out as hell,
          the band bailed because climbing is like hard, dude.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Grizzly T knew that in order to fulfill his
          destiny of winning a Tony award for his music videos, he must first be
          in a band that had music videos. Grizzly pushed onward by himself,
          hungry, tired, and alone. As he climbed closer to the top, he stopped
          to weep. An owl swooped down and morphed the fuck into a mythic sage.
          The hoot-ass bird dude could see that our courageous hero was in
          trouble, and spoke up, “I know you’re in pain, dear boy. Here, use my
          gold bond to powder your nuts.” As Grizzly applied the minty serum, a
          heavenly tingle overtook his loins. He now had the strength to
          continue his climb. Just as the moist tip of the summit was in sight,
          a clap of thunder darkened the sky, the clouds parted, and a great
          light appeared. From that light, The Great Booty in the Sky revealed
          itself before him, and painfully bestowed to him Thor’s Hammer.
          Inscribed in the Hammer were the words the Salvation now live by,
          “Booty ain’t got no brain.” Grizzly T lifted the heavenly weapon in
          his hands, heavy from the weight of the metal, but also the
          overwhelming responsibility that this hammer held.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With new vigor, Grizzly lunged back down the
          mountain to share his funky powers, reunite the band, and conquer the
          world.
